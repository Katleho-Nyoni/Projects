This repo holds some of the projects I have done to showcase my learning journey and experience. These projects were done in the following programming languages :
- R / RStudio
- Power BI.

## BRIEF DESCRIPTION
#### 1. BMD Analysis
This project uses the most recent and effective method of dealing with missing data and recovering(predicting) 25% of the data that was missing, greatly improving the quality of the data and reliability of future tests to be ran on that dataset.
#### 2. Employee's Satisfaction
The analyses investigates how gender and education affects the happiness of an emplpoyee at a certain company, using Data Analysis techniques and one similar to A/B testing.
#### 3. Finance Dashboard
Using Power BI, I was able to create an interactive dashboard that a team can constantly update with ease and consult to make decisions.
